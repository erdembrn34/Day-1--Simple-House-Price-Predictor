📝 Project Overview
This is the first project of my 210-day journey into AI, Data Engineering, and DevOps. Today, I implemented a Simple Linear Regression model to predict house prices based on square footage.

The goal of this project is to understand the fundamental relationship between a single independent variable (Square Meters) and a dependent variable (Price).

🚀 Technical ImplementationAlgorithm: Simple Linear Regression ($y = mx + b$)
Library: scikit-learn

Data Handling: pandas

Visualization: matplotlib

📊 Key Learnings
Understanding how a model "fits" a line to data points.

Reshaping data for scikit-learn input (2D arrays).

Making real-time predictions based on a trained model.

🛠️ How to Run
Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the script: python main.py
